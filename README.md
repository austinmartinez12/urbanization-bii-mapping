The purpose of this project was to analyze the Biodiversity Interacts Index(BII) in the Phoenix, Arizona subdivision between 2017 and 2020. Specifically, this project aimed to identify and quantify the amount of area with a BII ≥ 0.75 in 2017 but experienced a decline by 2020. By visualizing this decline in BII, I can more clearly show the extent of biodiversity loss across the Phoenix subdivision.
